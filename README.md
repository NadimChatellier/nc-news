## Project Overview

**Mithril News** is a fullstack application that allows users to post, interact with, and browse articles. The frontend is built using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool, providing a fast and efficient development experience. The app communicates with the backend via API calls, and the user interface is designed with **Material UI (MUI)** for a responsive, modern design.

This repository hosts the frontend portion of the application, which allows users to register, log in, create and view articles, and more.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Users can register, login, and authenticate via JWT tokens to access protected routes.
- **Article Management**: Users can view, create, update, and delete articles.
- **Responsive UI**: The application is mobile-friendly, with an intuitive interface designed using Material UI (MUI).
- **Real-Time Updates**: The application interacts with the backend, providing live updates when articles are created or modified.
- **Routing and State Management**: React Router is used for navigation, and global state is managed with Reactâ€™s Context API.
