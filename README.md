## Project Overview

**Mithril News** is a fullstack application that allows users to post, interact with, and browse articles. The frontend is built using **React** with **Vite** as the build tool, providing a fast and efficient development experience. The app communicates with the backend via API calls, and the user interface is designed with **Material UI (MUI)** for a responsive, modern design.

This repository hosts the frontend portion of the application, which allows users to register, log in, create and view articles, and more.
